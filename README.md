Peter Shirley's Weekend Renderer in Julia

From the eBook / Website

http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html

The C++ Code is at : https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend

I'm not versed enough in Github Lore to know how to link them together beyond a URL :)

cd into the directory and run julia main.jl

hand edit main.jl to run timed / profiled code

the output file is rendered progressively so if you have something like Gimp that can view PGM files without them being complete, it mean you can refresh it as it renders and see progress

I'm making a branch for Rendering the next week
